# Crawler
A simple web crawler in python

Requires python 2.x
No extra module needed

To test it , just run the crawl.py 
  example : python crawl.py
It will then automatically crawl pages as
long as its not stopped forcefully. And if 
restarted later , it will start from just where 
it stopped .  
Pages crawled will be stored in data folder.
For storage issues , only the outgoing links 
are stored in this case.
